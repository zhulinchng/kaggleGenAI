- Image
- Video
- Text
- **All of the above**

## Which of the following is a major advantage of ScaNN over other approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) search algorithms?

- It is open-source and widely available.
- **It is designed for high-dimensional data, and has excellent speed/accuracy tradeoffs.**
- ScaNN only returns exact matches.
- It is based on a simple hashing technique and has low computational overhead.

## What are some of the major weaknesses of bag-of-words (BOW) models for generating document embeddings?

- **They ignore word ordering and semantic meanings.**
- They are computationally expensive and require large amounts of data.
- They cannot be used for semantic search or topic discovery.
- Only effective for short documents and fail to capture long-range dependencies.

## Which of the following is a common challenge when using embeddings for search, and how can it be addressed?

- Embeddings cannot handle large datasets; use a smaller dataset.
- Embeddings are always superior to traditional search; no need to address.
- **Embeddings might not capture literal information well; combine with full-text search.**
- Embeddings change too frequently; prevent updates.

## What is the primary advantage of using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for vector search?

- It guarantees finding the exact nearest neighbors.
- **It reduces the search space by grouping similar items into hash buckets**
- The only method that works for high-dimensional vectors.
- It always provides the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.
