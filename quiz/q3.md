# Day 3 Quiz

## What is a generative Al agent?

- A type of machine learning model.
- **An application that can observe the world and act upon it, using tools.**
- An LLM that can only be used for text generation.
- A type of hardware for training LLMs.

## What is the primary function of the orchestration layer in a generative Al agent?

- To generate creative text and images.
- **To manage the agent's internal reasoning and planning process.**
- To interact with users through a conversational interface.
- To store and retrieve data from external sources.

## In what scenario might a developer choose to use Functions over Extensions in a Generative Al Agent?

- When the agent needs to make multiple API calls in a sequence.
- When the API requires real-time interaction with the agent.
- **When the developer needs more control over the data flow and API execution.**
- When the API is easily accessible by the agent's infrastructure.

## What is the purpose of Data Stores in a Generative Al Agent?

- To store the agent's configuration settings and parameters.
- **To provide the agent with access to dynamic and up-to-date information.**
- To execute complex calculations and data transformations.
- To monitor and evaluate the agent's performance over time.

## Which of the following is not a characteristic typically associated with generative Al agents?

- They can create new content, such as text, images, or music.
- They can learn from large datasets to identify patterns and generate similar content.
- **They possess inherent consciousness and understanding of the content they create.**
- They can be used for tasks like translation, summarization, and content creation.

## What is the "mixture of agent experts" approach in agent development?

- Combining multiple language models with a single agent.
- Using a variety of tools to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Combining specialized agents, each excelling in a particular domain or task.**
- Integrating different reasoning frameworks within the orchestration layer.
