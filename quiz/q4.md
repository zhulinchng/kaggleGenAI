# Day 4 Quiz

## What is the primary goal of MedLM in the medical field?

- To replace doctors with Al systems for more efficient patient care.
- To develop Al models capable of diagnosing and treating diseases without human intervention.
- **To improve health outcomes by making advanced Al technology available to healthcare professionals.**
- To create a universal Al system that can answer any medical question with 100% accuracy.

## What is the significance of "ensemble refinement" (ER) in MedPaLM v2?

- #It allows the model to learn from patient data.
- It improves the model's ability to generate multiple-choice questions.
- It helps the model identify medical images.
- **It enhances the model's reasoning and answer refinement by conditioning it on multiple generated reason pathways.**

## What is the innovative approach used by SecLM to address security challenges?

- Developing a highly complex Al model with trillions of parameters for superior performance.
- Replacing human security analysts with fully autonomous Al agents.
- **Combining large language models, authoritative data sources,and a flexible planning framework.**
- Creating a global database of all known cyber threats for real-time threat detection.

## How does SecLM address the challenge of limited publicly available security data?

- By collecting and storing sensitive user data for central model training.
- **By developing specialized LLMs trained on cybersecurity specific content and tasks.**
- By relying solely on open-source security dat for model training.
- By generating synthetic security data to augment limited public data.
